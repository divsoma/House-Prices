California Housing Prices
The dataset for this study was taken from the 1990 census of California.There are about 20640 rows and 9 collumn. This study has the following objectives

Objective 1: To identify the location where maximum number of Households are situated.
Objective 2: To identify the Features of High Priced Locality and Low Priced Locality.
Objective 3: To identify the income groups who own Houses.
Objective 4: To identify the factors that lead to determination of House Prices.

Reason to choose: I am an Economics student. I have a keen interest in studying about demand and pricing theories. Through this project I got an opportunity to test my theoretical knowledge in real world scenario.

Pandas Methods used in this project: info(), describe(),isna(),sum(),mean(),value_count(),groupby(),max(),min(),median(),corr(),

Graphs used: Scatter Plot, Pie Chart, Histogram, Heatmaps

Methodology: Histogram and Pie Chart were used to identify the location where maximum number of houses were situated.Conditional filtering was applied to identify the characteristics of High Priced locality and low Priced locality. Correlation, heatmaps and scatter plots  were used to identify the relationship between the various factors and House prices.

Conclusion: Majority of the population reside in the South West Region of California. The House Price starts falling as we go towards the north. The average income of households is between $3,00,00 to $4,00,000. There is a very weak correlation between age of the building , total number of bedrooms, total number of rooms, households and House Prices.
